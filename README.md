📘 RaceFi — Formula-1 Themed Blockchain Security Ecosystem

RaceFi is a next-generation AI + Web3 project inspired by Formula 1 racing, combining speed, security, and gamification into one platform.

🚀 What It Does

Smart Contract Scanning & Audit — Pre-deployment checks and vulnerability detection using automated tools.

MEV & Bot Attack Mitigation — Real-time detection of front-running, sandwich attacks, and suspicious mempool behavior.

Protected Transaction Routing — Reroute transactions via safe relayers or private channels when risk is detected.

Interactive Frontend Experience — A Formula-1 style dashboard visualizing transactions as “cars,” flags for safety or risk, and race-track metaphors.

Simulations & Learning Tools — (In progress) Users can experience “race scenarios” to see how attacks evolve and how RaceFi protects.

🏁 Why It Matters

Blockchain ecosystems — especially in the context of fan tokens, NFTs, and high-frequency trading — are vulnerable to exploitative bots and unfair attacks.
RaceFi bridges the gap by making blockchain fast, safe, and transparent, giving developers, traders, and projects the trust and protection they need.

🧱 Repo Structure (Core Modules)

contracts / contracts-clean — Smart contracts (token transfers, withdrawal flows)

backend — Server logic for monitoring, routing & safe mode

frontend / src — UI layer and interactive dashboard

Utility files & configuration: color themes, implementation guides, quick references, etc.

🛠 How to Get Started

Clone the repo

Set up environment variables and dependencies

Deploy smart contracts using the contracts folder

Launch backend monitoring + relayer module

Start the frontend app

Interact with the RaceFi dashboard — see transactions, view safety status, test attack scenarios
